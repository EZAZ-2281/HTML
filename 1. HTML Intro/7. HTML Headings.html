HTML Headings
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.
-----
Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.
Bigger Headings
Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property:
Example
<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>
