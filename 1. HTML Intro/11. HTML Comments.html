HTML Comment Tag
You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:
<!-- Write your comments here -->
Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag.
-----
Add Comments
With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code:
Example
<!-- This is a comment -->
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<!-- Remember to add more information here -->
-----
Hide Content
Comments can be used to hide content.
Example
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<!-- <p>This is another paragraph </p> -->
<p>This is a paragraph too.</p>
-----
You can also hide more than one line, everything between the <!-- and the --> will be hidden from the display.
Example
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<!--
<p>Look at this cool image:</p>
<img border="0" src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli">
-->
<p>This is a paragraph too.</p>
-----
Hide Inline Content
Example
<p>This <!-- great text --> is a paragraph.</p>
