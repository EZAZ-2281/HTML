Empty HTML Elements
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:
Example
<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>
----
HTML is Not Case Sensitive
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
